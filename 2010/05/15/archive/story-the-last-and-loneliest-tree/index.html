      <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;"> “Stars in the dawning, stars in the quiet night,<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Stars in her hair, and in her bright eyes;<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Stars everywhere, and unto the stars I fly,<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">I swallow the sun, and quench the moonlight.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">The sun burns a fire inside my soul,<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Thoughts sacred and profane, lurid and bold<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">I swallow the oceans to drench the flames cold<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">The galaxies fade dark, I’m a black hole.”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">The evening was hot and dry, about 54 Celsius, unusual for January in Bangalore. Partho walked in the dimming light towards the Last and Loneliest Tree, trying to push the angry thoughts out of his head. He needed to sit down, and push out the ancient yet still-fresh thoughts of jealousy and confusion that continued to rage in him. He had to get his mind in control. If he continued to let his emotions sway him, it would be yet another trip to the psych.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Partho’s head throbbed, images and words of their break-up still fresh in his mind. He walked faster, trying to push away the violent thoughts that were crowding together in his head. He started into a trot, beads of sweat running down his face. Suddenly, Partho swayed, retched and leaned for support against the façade of a store. Partho’s knees felt weak, and his mouth was parched. He licked his lips, and adjusted his glasses that had slid down the bridge of his nose. “How could she?” the question remained unanswered even thirty years later.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">He pushed himself up, chastising himself for his puerile behavior, and he forced himself into a strained and slow walk. Soon, his nerves won over his mind and he was once again striding towards his destination. However, as he approached the Jacaranda tree, a beggar approached him and held out his arms in front of Partho and said,<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“<em>Jo tum khoj rahe ho, woh is samay mein nahin hai;
</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;"><em>Jise tumhari talash hai, woh taaron mein kahin hai.
</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;"><em>Yeh zindagi jeene ka mantar kya hai?</em><br>        </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;"><em>Ishq aur maut mein antar kya hai?”
</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Partho stood still, shocked. Those words were unknown to him, yet something in them soothed him. He reached into his pocket for some loose change, but the mendicant was gone. Partho looked up, and the world seemed a different place, calmer and quieter. His own mind was more at peace, in an introspective mood, as though it had been engaged in some deep mystery, and the angry thoughts of just minutes ago disappeared into a dark recess in the labyrinth of his brain.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">On a hunch, Partho turned around, and started back towards his car that was parked two blocks away. Something told him that the tree needed to wait, that he had to be home instead.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">-*-<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Anya woke with a start. “What a strange dream”, she thought, “I always have the strangest dreams when I sleep in the evening.” She poured herself a glass of water from the jug near her bed, and drank it to clear the metallic after-taste of the cyclopraxtin. Indranil had asked her to not take more than 1 pill a day, but she was already overdosing 4 pills. She would have to make a trip to the pharmacy soon with another fake prescription.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Indranil,” she called out, “I had the strangest dream. Where are you, come here.” Her husband walked into the room, carrying two steaming cups of tea. “What dream?” he asked.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Well, you know the library near our house. Well, I was in the library, reading a book.”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“When did you go to the library?”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“<em>Arre</em><br>            <em>yaar</em>, in the dream. I was in the library, reading a book, a biography of Einstein, you know the scientist from Ma-Earth. It was a really fascinating book, so I checked-out the book and was leaving the library, when this beggar-man came up to me, you know, just like how it used to be in the old country.”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Wow, you really are having trippy dreams – are you doing too much cyclops?”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“No <em>baba</em>, I’m just doing what you said. Anyway, in the dream the beggar handed me this piece of paper. It said, ‘Call me in the evening, the number is 22602728. Ask for Argus Bookstore. We need to go on a long journey, a nautical journey.’ I looked up, and the beggar was gone.”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Wow, what a detailed dream, sweet-heart. <em>Chalo</em>, call <em>karte hain</em>, its evening now<em>.”
</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“What, are you out of your mind? It was just a dream.”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“No, no, let’s call, it’ll be interesting. What if there actually is an Argus Bookstore?”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Anya rose from the bed, and reluctantly picked up her mobile. She knew that it was no use protesting, that Indranil would himself make the call if she didn’t. She dialed the number, and put the phone on speaker so that Indranil could listen in. The phone rang many times, before it was picked up and a familiar but breathless voice said,<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Hello?”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Is it Argus Bookstore?”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“No, my store is no more,<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Who do you want, may —-“<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“The store is no more, did you say?”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Yes, the store closed 2 years ago.”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Damn, who am I speaking to?”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Partho, my name is Partho.”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Anya collapsed on the floor, the phone rattling out of her hand. Partho, could it indeed be her Partho?<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">-*-<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Partho sat near the Last and Loneliest Tree, the last tree in Bangalore. It was an old Jacaranda that had surprised everyone by weathering the changing monsoon pattern and the growing heat to remain as the only surviving tree in Bangalore.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Partho, of course, knew the real reason it had survived. It was here, under this Jacaranda that he and Anya had met on so many days after work, where they had made their vows to marry and where they had broken up. This tree was the last symbol of their love, the one thing that kept Partho sane in a mad and changing world.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Thirty years. It was a long time since they had broken up. He had been 27, a gifted artist, madly in love with Anya, his muse, his genius, his demon. She had been 25, a successful trend-hunter, in love with Partho, her poet, her musician, her lover.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">It had been perfect. That is, till the climate started changing dramatically and all scientific efforts had been channeled towards finding alternate sources of energy, finding ways to control the climate, finding ways to colonize the planets and ways to travel at close to light-speeds. Finding alternate sources of energy or ways to control the climate had failed. Then, the breakthroughs: an aircraft that could travel near light-speed and an Earth-like planet just a few light-years away that could be colonized.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Anya had been thrilled – a trend-hunters perfect dream, a new planet to explore. They had fought daily, bitterly, for weeks – how could she even think of going to the new planet when he was here, on Earth? They had broken up then, beneath their Jacaranda tree.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">He had missed her terribly, but he had resolved to not call her. She missed him even more, but all her work on researching the new planet and planning her trip there kept her busy for months. She did everything to make sure that she would be on the first civilian flight to New Earth – till they rejected her application on grounds of her psych test coming back as negative.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">She was devastated. Her dreams of reaching for the stars had been shattered in a cruel twist of fate. She had always been confident, had been strong, had been fast and clear-headed – but her psych test results were unambiguous. She was unstable, unsuitable for space travel.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">In times of despair, she had always turned to one person, the person she hadn’t called for months. Partho welcomed her into his house and shared her despair and gloom. They made love like they had once, and resolved to stay by each other forever. He fussed over her, pampered her, and when he found her psych reports, he had referred her to his close friend, Dr. Indranil.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Partho recalled the moment clearly still, with all the jealousy, pain, confusion and anger that had followed. Anya had called to meet him near the Jacaranda tree. That’s where she told him,<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“I am marrying next Tuesday,<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">And leaving for New-Earth. ‘Thank you’,<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">You have been too kind to say<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">those words to. True,<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">I love you madly,<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">And will ever do.”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">-*-<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Anya dry-swallowed another cyclops pill, it helped keep her calm – she had just spoken to a ghost from the past, and God knew she needed the medicine. Partho – he must be in his late fifties now – she had spoken to Partho.  She was still just thirty-one, thanks to the wonders of near light-speed travel.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">She still loved him. She knew that in her heart, that she had never stopped loving her crazy Partho. She liked Indranil too, and had grown fond of him, but he had never roused the same wildness of passion in her that Partho had.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Indranil had been a convenience, her way of chasing her dreams to New Earth, of being the first trend-hunter to set foot on this place and report back home the wonders of a new colony. Even after all the years of travel and the four years here, her mind told her that she had made the right decision of leaving Partho to chase her dreams.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">She was still the best and most successful trend-hunter, New Earth had been everything it had promised, Indranil was kind and loving as ever – why then did she feel an emptiness?<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">Should she call Partho again? The number floated in front of her eyes, 22602728, urging her to call.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Partho, it’s me, it’s your Anya.”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Partho, it’s me – from the stars, your Anya.”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">“Partho, do you recognize my voice – it’s me.”<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">No, she wouldn’t call. That would just be unfair to him – after all these years, who knew how he had changed? He probably had married, had kids and settled down. She felt a pang of jealousy at the thought, and smiled, for she knew the irony of her thought.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">The days turned to weeks, her cyclops consumption increased to 6, her research showed that Partho was still single and she grew more restless, more certain about what she wanted to do. There was only one thing to be done – she had to find him again, she had to meet him, she had to say how sorry she was for all the good times that she had left behind. She knew it was a ridiculous idea – it would ruin her career, it would upset Indranil, and when she got back to Ma-Earth, Partho would be in his eighties. But there was nothing else to be done.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">So she did it. Just like the time before, once her mind was made, she knew it could not be changed. It was a long flight back - only three of her years passed, but thirty passed on Ma-Earth. She landed at the Bangalore spaceport, the sweltering heat and the artificial greenery serving as a reminder of the reasons she had left.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">She was surprised at how little the city had changed – she drove confidently towards their Jacaranda tree, after which she would go and surprise Partho. She got off the car at the Last and Loneliest Tree, and broke down into tears.<br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:10pt;">The Last and Loneliest Tree had died. Where once there had been a blossoming Jacaranda in the Garden City, there now was the husk of what once used to be a tree. Anya got back into her car. It would be a long journey back to New Earth.<br></span></p>
