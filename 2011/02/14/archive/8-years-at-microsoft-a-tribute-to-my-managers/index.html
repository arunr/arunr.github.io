        <p>I joined Microsoft 8 years ago to this day. Many of my friends from business school were surprised - I was a LAMP stack kinda guy who had spent more time on the command line than in the classroom! One of my friends told me, “You are too free-spirited to last more than a year in the corporate world”, and I had responded with, “I’ll check it out for a year or two, and then I’ll go do something else if I don’t like it!”.</p>
<p>It surprises me how fast these 8 years have gone by - it is the passion for customers, the caring about the details &amp; the smarts of the people of Microsoft that first made me stay, and then fall in love with this company (or it may be the more mundane fact that I joined Microsoft on Valentine’s Day!)</p>
<p>However, more than anything, I’ve had the most wonderful managers at Microsoft: people who have cared, people I have been able to learn from, and people I have hoped to emulate. This post is a tribute to the six great managers I’ve had during my 8 years at Microsoft (I know some of you guys are reading this - you always taught me to “ask for forgiveness, not permission”, so forgive me if I misrepresent you in any way!)</p>
<hr>
<p><a id="more"></a>My first manager, Krishna, was the one I must thank for two things: first, for bringing me back to earth after B-school had me flying in the clouds &amp; second, for helping me re-discover my latent love for technology &amp; programming which I had become ashamed of professing after getting an MBA.</p>
<p>Krishna used to be in an office down the hall from me, and I always knew he was thinking hard about something when I heard him whistling a <em>carnatic</em> tune. A few days after I started at Microsoft, Krishna had probably had enough of my always talking about business and strategy! He came into my office, whistling one of his tunes, and said, “I’ve got a special assignment for you to do”.</p>
<p>“What is it?”, I asked, excited at the prospect of finally doing something fun.</p>
<p>“There are 30 PREfix / PREfast bugs that we need to get fixed and the team is a little short on time - I’d like you to fix them.”</p>
<p>I surely must be hearing wrong, I thought, “You mean get them fixed by the dev team? You want me to co-ordinate the fixing of the bugs, should I draw up a plan?”!</p>
<p>“No - I want you to fix them. Get a code enlistment, and fix the bugs. By the way, they are due on Friday.”</p>
<p>I broke out into a cold sweat! “Me - fixing bugs, after spending money on an MBA?”, I thought, “This can’t be true!”.</p>
<p>Well, I buckled down, fixed those bugs with some help from the developers, didn’t die and in the process I learnt what it meant to do real work, re-learnt how fixing bugs was fun, and learnt what it meant to help out your team.</p>
<p>Over the next two years that I worked with Krishna, I learnt to fall back in love with technology &amp; programming - I did code reviews, exchanged puzzles with my dev &amp; test buddies and talked about the latest gadgets and the newest SDK’s.</p>
<p>I must admit that it definitely was fun seeing the roll of the eyes when I told my B-school brethren that I had done a code review, when they were saying they re-did the fonts on a powerpoint for the VP or couriered a spreadsheet to the partner!</p>
<hr>
<p>Mikky was my second manager at Microsoft. I learnt so much from Mikky just by observing him in meetings and walking around with him. He was one of the best program managers I have ever seen, and wonderful guy to work for. From Mikky, I learnt the heart of program management - making trade-offs (balance), making forward progress (taking decisions) and getting the best out of people (by helping them).</p>
<p>From Mikky I learnt to not be afraid of failing, to really think through what customers want and the one lesson that I will never forget - design consistency!</p>
<p>I was so enthusiastic about doing the right thing, that I and one of my best developers re-did the design for our feature (without consulting the designer!), and it was oh-so-beautiful. In my excitement, I rushed to Mikky’s office and said, “Come on, I’ve got to show you something, you’ll love it!”</p>
<p>I walked him to my developers office, where we demo’d the new feature, and I saw Mikky grimace. He exploded right there, the first time I had seen him do that - “I thought you knew <em>something </em> about program management!”, he said caustically, “OK, tell me - do you want to decide what you’ll do with these changes, or do you want me to decide?”.</p>
<p>“But Mikky!”, I cried, only to be cut off mid-sentence.</p>
<p>“You decide, or I’ll decide for you”, he said and stormed away.</p>
<p>“But it’s better”, I called out after him.</p>
<p>Over my weekly meetings with Mikky, I heard about design consistency, about how to influence changing the entire system or play by the rules, about how I couldn’t design things in isolation, about how I committed a grave sin by not talking to my designer! I didn’t hear the end of it for months!</p>
<p>From Mikky, I learnt almost everything I needed to learn about program management - thanks for everything, Mikky!</p>
<hr>
<p>Tom, my third manager, was my manager for a short time. Tom was an absolute dream manager to work for - he let me do things mostly my own way, and once in a while he would drop a suggestion and move on and let me pick it up if I chose, reminding me repeatedly if he really wanted me to pick up on that suggestion!</p>
<p>I learnt technology from Krishna, program management from Mikky and I learnt so much about managing people from Tom.</p>
<p>Only after becoming a people manager myself, making all the mistakes in the book and going through a really tough process of learning how to do the job did I get a true appreciation for how effortlessly Tom managed people.</p>
<p>I said to him once, years after he stopped being my manager - “Tom, I never realized at the time that managing people was work, I thought you were just goofing off all day! How did you do it?”, and he just laughed at me! Looking back, I think it was first from Tom that I learnt what a difference it makes if you can really care for people, genuinely and with the willingness to listen to them.</p>
<p>For the A-type in me, it was a very hard lesson to learn - and I learnt it best from observing Tom.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sridhar was everything that Mikky was not, and I was sure the day that I met him that we wouldn’t get along. He was very intense, and didn’t seem to have a sense of humor - I think I walked away from our first meeting thinking, “This is not going to work out”.</p>
<p>But how wrong I was, and how glad I am about how wrong I was! Sri was a great manager - but more important is what a wonderful, genuine person he is. There are two things that stand in my mind when I think back at working with Sri: how much he cared about every little thing and how he set himself to a high standard, and how he himself put a huge effort into learning and improving.</p>
<p>What I remember best though was how he worked with me for over six months in thinking about my move back from Redmond to India. He took the time to understand my motivations, to listen to my concerns, to support my move and even help me after I moved to Microsoft India - and he always made the time to talk to me about it, whenever I wanted.</p>
<p>Sri - thank you for supporting my move back to India, thank you for teaching me to care about the details and most of all - thank you for helping me develop an attitude of learning.</p>
<hr>
<p>When I moved back to India, I reported to Ganesh. I knew Ganesh before he became my manager, and I was sure that it work out fine with Ganesh. In the two years that I reported to Ganesh, I got the opportunity to work again on my people management skills - and I could learn from the best, for Ganesh was an exceptional people manager.</p>
<p>Two things stand out in my mind when I think back at Ganesh, things that I continue to be amazed by.</p>
<p>Firstly, he had really good ideas, ideas that were surprisingly and unexpectedly good - I don’t mean that to be rude in any way, and in full respect I can say this - I don’t have as many good ideas as Ganesh does, and I still don’t know how he does it! I am an analytical type who can do a fish-bone diagram in my head to come to conclusions, and by the time I had walked the first tooth of the fish-bone, Ganesh would have come up with so many ideas - to me, it looked like he was throwing darts, and I remain astounded at the accuracy of his aim!</p>
<p>Secondly, Ganesh really had a natural talent for bringing together people and leading a team. Our team, like other teams, went through it troughs and lows, but one thing was guaranteed - everyone felt much better about themselves, about life and about the world once Ganesh had finished a team meeting. Again, I don’t know how he did it - it was like magic! I think it again goes back to genuinely caring for people - from Tom &amp; Sri I learnt how to care for people as individuals, but from Ganesh I hope I learnt a little bit about how to care for people, not only as individuals, but also as part of a team whose success and growth he deeply cared for.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hari is my current boss, and I haven’t worked with him for long. However, there are two things I can already see myself learning from him and trying to emulate, both of which are about being a better engineer.</p>
<p>Firstly, he speaks whats on his mind in every setting, quite curt and sharp - it doesn’t matter if it’s his team he is talking to, the larger team that we are part of or a meeting with execs, Hari says what is on his mind. I really love this, for it is very common to see people (and I must admit - I have done this too!) change colors based on who the audience is: they are different in talking with their team and different when talking to execs. I really like it that Hari is just being himself all the time, and give-a-damn who is looking - how cool is that?!</p>
<p>Secondly, he exhibits in his own work and emphasizes to us the importance of sticking to the knitting and getting the basics right. Given that he is a veteran at Microsoft, this is just great to see - the more time you spend at the company, the more you realize the importance doing the simple and small things well.</p>
<hr>
<p>Eight years, six great managers - I really have been lucky.</p>
<p>A love for technology, the basics of program management, managing people, caring about the details, cultivating an attitude of learning, having great ideas, leading teams, being yourself, doing the simple and small things well and becoming a better engineer - what a brilliant buffet of ideas to eat from.</p>
<p>Thank you, to each one of you - I hope to emulate some of what you have taught me in my own work.</p>
<p>Till then, I’ll keep learning!</p>
