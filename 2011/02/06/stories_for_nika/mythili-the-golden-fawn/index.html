        <p>Once upon a time, long, long ago, there lived a beautiful golden fawn. The fawn lived in the jungle with it’s mother, father, one brother and two sisters.</p>
<p>The fawn used to love playing with its brother and sisters - they used to skip, jump and gambol in the jungle, eating tasty grass, leaves and plants. They loved the jungle, and were very happy there. Like this, many days passed.<a id="more"></a></p>
<p>One day, a monkey came to the part of the jungle the fawn was in, and made a  <em>chee-chee-chee</em> noise. The fawn’s father and the monkey spoke for a long time. That evening, the golden fawns father called the entire family.</p>
<p>“That monkey is a friend of mine” he said. “He told me that man is in the jungle. There are hunters near by who are coming in this direction. The have guns, and they are killing animals. It is not safe here anymore. I have decided that early tomorrow morning, we will go deeper into the jungle. There is a river not so far from here, and they monkey says that he knows a narrow part of the river, where we all can jump across the river to the other side. We will be safer there, and will have lots of food.”</p>
<p>The fawn was scared, and so was its brother and its sisters. They all slept snuggled close to their Ma that night. Early next morning, the family of deer started walking towards the river. The monkey led them to a narrow part of the river, where they could jump across. First, the mamma deer sailed across the river with a graceful leap and then called from the other side, “Don’t be afraid children, it is very easy to jump this river.”</p>
<p>One by one, the fawns brother and her sisters jumped across the river too. The fawn was very scared, but she gathered up all her courage, and ran fast to the edge of the river to jump. Sadly, at the last moment her food got snagged in a creeper, and she fell into the fast flowing river. Her father jumped into the river and tried to catch her with his mouth, but his mouth snapped at empty air. She was flowing down the river fast, and she opened her eyes wide and tried to see her full family for the last time.</p>
<p>The fawn was very, very lucky. After a while, there was a bend in the river and a log of wood was stuck in the river. The river pushed her against the log, and then washed her onto the side. This was a part of the jungle that the fawn had never seen. She was feeling sad that she was away from her family, but she was hungry too. She picked herself up and started to explore.</p>
<p>The fawn soon came across a garden, with tasty grass, lots of flowers and vegetables like carrots and beets. She hungrily started chomping the grass, when she heard a voice, “Who is that in my garden? Shoo, oh, look, it’s a golden fawn!”. The voice belonged to Mythili, a girl who lived in the forest with her mother and father.</p>
<p>“Ma, look, there is a golden fawn, it’s so beautiful, can we keep her here with us?”, Mythili called out again to her mother. The girl ran up to the golden fawn and gently touched it on the head. “Oh, look, it is hurt here,” said Mythili, pointing to the fawns leg, where it was injured. Mythili gently washed the wound and put a bandage on it.</p>
<p>The fawn was happy to have been saved and found a family to live with, but it was also sad that it was far from her own family. Every day, the fawn would play with Mythili all day - they would explore the jungle, roll in the grass and eat tasty berries from Mythili’s garden. They would go home only in the evening, when Mythili’s mother would come out and gently scold both of them, and then give Mythili a big hug.</p>
<p>One evening, as Mythili’s mother gave her a hug, the fawn remembered her own mother, and snuggling up to her the night before they went to cross the river. Remembering this, the fawn felt very sad, and a tear-drop rolled down its face. Mythili saw this, and being a very clever and loving girl, she said “Ma, I think my fawn is also missing her mother.”</p>
<p>Saying this, Mythili hugged the fawn, and whispered in her ear, “Where have you come from mysterious golden fawn? Are you missing your Ma, shall we look for her?”.</p>
<p>That evening Mythili told her father, “We must help my fawn find her family. Pappa, we have to go tomorrow itself, you have to help me!”. Mythili’s father was the forest ranger, and was very brave - but whenever Mythili asked for anything, he became so gently and always agreed to whatever she said.</p>
<p>The very next morning they set out, looking around their home to see where the fawn could have come from. “I think she came from upstream,” her father said, “Let us look that way for deer tracks.”. The searched for a few hours that morning, without luck. But Mythili wouldn’t give up, and every morning she would wake up her father, and all three of them - Mythili, Mythili’s father and the fawn - would go looking for deer tracks.</p>
<p>After many days of searching in vain, Mythili’s father said, “Let us see, maybe we will be lucky on the other side of the river.” They crossed over to the other side of the river in a boat, and immediately Mythili’s father said, “I can smell deer. I think the smell is coming from upstream, that’s where the wind is blowing from.” He was excited, and they started to walk fast.</p>
<p>Soon, they came across deer droppings too. “These are quite fresh,” Mythili’s father said, “we can’t be far!”. All of them were excited now. Suddenly, Mythili’s father slowed down and hid behind a bush, “Careful, now!”, he said, “I can sense some trouble.”</p>
<p>They all hid behind the bush, and suddenly they heard a crack of a gunshot in the air. The hunters had also crossed the river, and they were shooting at the deer. Mythili’s father had brought along his big rifle, and he picked it up and fired into the air, one, two, three times! He then shouted, “I am the forest ranger, who is that firing at my animals?”.</p>
<p>He saw some of the hunters and fired at them, and that sent them packing. They all ran away fast, before Mythili’s father could catch them and lock them up in jail. They had reached just in time, at the same time that the hunters had also crossed the river - if it had been another day, or even a few hours more, maybe the deer family would not have been so lucky. No one had been injured in the gun-fire.</p>
<p>The golden fawn suddenly saw it’s mother, and ran so fast to her Ma. She squealed and jumped up to her Ma, and then rolled with her brother and her sisters in the grass. Her father was so happy to see her too - after falling in the river, he had swum across to the other side, but he had been very sad for his favorite, youngest fawn. “We will not leave this place, in case she comes back”, he had said, and he had been right!</p>
<p>Mythili was so happy to see her fawn finally find her family. She gave her father a big hug! The entire deer family came up to them and nuzzled against Mythili and her father, to thank them and let them know how happy they were to have their daughter back with them.</p>
<p>From that day, the golden fawn lived happily with her own family. Every few days Mythili’s father would row Mythili across the river, and leave her with the deer family, and they would all play in the grass all day long. And as for those hunters, the rifle shots from Mythili’s fathers gun had scared them away, and they never, ever came back.</p>
<p>Mythili lived happily ever after with her best friend, the golden fawn.</p>
