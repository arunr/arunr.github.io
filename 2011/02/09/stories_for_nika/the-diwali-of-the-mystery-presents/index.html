        <p>Once upon a time, long, long ago there was a wonderful, happy family. There was a mother, a father, two sons named Vishnu and Shyam and a pretty little girl called Kritika.</p>
<p>Vishnu, the older, lanky son was very quiet and gentle, and loved lying in the sun, sleeping or reading books. Shyam, the younger, plump son was very mischievous and was always getting into trouble, but he got away from a scolding because of his wonderful smile and happy laugh! Vishnu and Shyam both loved their younger sister Kritika very much - Kritika was a very happy and lively child, who said just the funniest things. Kritika loved dancing, eating mangoes and bursting crackers during her favorite festival, Diwali.</p>
<p>All the three kids loved their parents, and their parents loved them very much too. This story is about a mystery that happened to this family during one Diwali…<a id="more"></a></p>
<p>This year, when the story is happening, the family was going through a lot of problems. Their mother had lost her job sewing clothes in the garment factory, because the factory had shut down. Their father had not got his salary for 4 months from the car factory where he worked. The family was running short on money. However, the mother and father never told their kids of their problems, and took out from their savings to make sure that their kids got whatever they needed.</p>
<p>But one day, soon after the monsoons had finally stopped, their father called the entire family into the dining room before dinner time. The kids could see that their father was struggling to say what he wanted to tell them.</p>
<p>Finally, with a sigh, he said, “Diwali will be coming soon, and every year, since I was a little boy myself, our family has celebrated Diwali with a lot of crackers, presents for everyone and with wonderful food. This is our favorite festival, our biggest festival. I feel very sad, but this year, we cannot afford to have such a big Diwali - we just don’t have enough money. I have a very important thing to ask all of you now. I will save money for the next few months, and we can have Diwali, but we can only get crackers or presents, not both. So kids, tell me - what do you want for Diwali, crackers or presents?”.</p>
<p>Seeing the glum look on their fathers face, Vishnu spoke up, and said, “Papa, we don’t want anything - we can live without crackers or presents for one year, it’s OK!”.</p>
<p>“Yes, Papa, we can just go to the beach and play ball, that’s enough to have a fun Diwali”, Shyam also chimed in.</p>
<p>Hearing this, their father and mother had tears in their eyes. But Kritika, who was the smallest, and didn’t really understand what was happening chimed up, “No, I want crackers! Let us have crackers please!”. This made all of them burst out laughing, and they forgot their sorrow for a while.</p>
<p>“OK, crackers it is, for little Kritika,” their father said with a smile, “she is the youngest, and the one who has us all wrapped around her little finger, and we will all do what she wants!”. The family was in better spirits, and they finished their dinner that day and went to sleep with happy hearts.</p>
<hr>
<p>The months rolled by, and the family’s situation didn’t improve. Diwali was approaching, and mother felt afraid for father, that he wouldn’t be able to get the crackers and that it would break his heart. Finally, it was the evening before Diwali, and the kids saw their father come home with boxes of crackers - he had done various odd jobs for the last few months without any of them knowing, and had saved the money to buy the crackers for them. The kids jumped up with joy, and ran inside the house to tell their mother. There, mother also had a surprise for them: she too had been saving a few rupees here and there and had made wonderful <em>laddoos</em>, <em>payasam </em> and a feast of a dinner!</p>
<p>Father came into the house, and put all the boxes of crackers in front of the idols in their <em>puja</em> room. “Tomorrow morning, we’ll get up and pray to God to help us out, and then we will go with a smile and burst so many crackers,” he said, “Now let us go and have this surprise dinner that your mother has made!”.</p>
<p>The kids were almost too excited to eat, but their mother had made an extra-special effort, and her usually tasty food was just heavenly today! They slowed down, and ate to their fill and finally when all the dishes were wiped clean, they heaved out sighs of contentment.</p>
<p>“Mother, you are the most beautiful woman in the world!”, Vishnu said. “Yes, and the best cook too!”, said Shyam. “Yes, Ma, and you tell the best stories - can you tell me a story now before bed?”, said little Kritika, making them all laugh again. They went to bed that night forgetting their troubles for a while. Only father didn’t sleep, for he was still feeling a little sad that he couldn’t buy presents for anyone this Diwali. Finally, father too dozed off and started snoring gently.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next day morning, their mother woke the kids up, and was also shaking father awake, “Come on, get up, all of you - it’s Diwali!”, she said. All of them jumped out of bed in excitement, father too! “Come kids, go to the bathroom, brush your teeth fast, let us go and pray quickly and go out to burst crackers!”, he said.</p>
<p>They all got ready quickly, and then went to the <em>Puja</em> room with their father to pray, and then open the boxes of crackers.</p>
<p>But what did they see when they got there? They saw wonderful packages of presents, wrapped in colorful foil and marked for each one of them. There was a big package wrapped in gold for mother. There was a small box wrapped in blue for father. There was a squarish box wrapped in silver for Vishnu, a green and round package for Shyam and a pink package for Kritika.</p>
<p>Kritika let out a squeal of delight, and said, “Presents! Where did they come from?”. Mother and father looked at each other, very surprised! The boys too were excited - “Who got these gifts for us, was it Lord Krishna?”, Shyam asked.</p>
<p>“This is a complete mystery,” father said at last, looking very puzzled. “Mother, did you have anything to do with this?”.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t. Come on, let us open the gifts, maybe we will find out who is behind this mystery!”, said mother, who eyes were shining with excitement and happiness. The kids giggled, because they had never seen their mother this way!</p>
<p>Mother quickly opened her package, and let out a squeal - she sounded almost like Kritika! The kids laughed, “My old and torn red sweater that had gone missing, look it has been cleaned and darned!”, she said, beaming with joy. “Winter is coming, and this is such a wonderful gift!”.</p>
<p>She told father, “Come on, open your box, father!”. Father was squinting, he looked so puzzled, and he opened his box slowly. “Look, look,”, he said, “it is my fathers watch that had stopped working. It has been fixed, and has been polished to a shine!”. He was so happy, he had a large grin on his face.</p>
<p>Vishnu had a collection of comics, Shyam had got back his favorite old football that he had lost in the rain and Kritka was the happiest - her favorite doll, who had lost an eye and who’s clothes had become old and dirty had been fixed! Her doll looked brand new again - she had been cleaned and outfitted with clean new baby clothes and a charming eye-patch!</p>
<p>The whole family was so happy with their gifts, that they were laughing with joy. “This is such a mystery, who could have done this?”, mother said at last.</p>
<p>Who do you think it was? Was it Lord Ganesh? Or maybe it was Lord Ram? Was it one of the boys, maybe it was mischievous Shyam? Who do you think it was?</p>
<hr>
<p>“It must be one of these brats, come on, who is behind this mystery, tell me right now!”, father ordered.</p>
<p>Finally, they saw Vishnu smile.</p>
<p>“It was me, Dad,” he owned up, “A few months ago when you told us that we wouldn’t get presents, I had an idea that I would keep an eye out for old and broken things that I could fix and give us for Diwali as presents! I found that Ma’s sweater was torn, and that your watch was not working and that Kritika’s doll was also looking very old.”</p>
<p>“But what about my football?”, Shyam asked. “Ah, that, I’m sorry, but I took your old football away and hid it one day when you had carelessly left it outside our house!”, Vishnu grinned.</p>
<p>Shyam laughed and threw the football at him, saying, “Yes, I remember being very puzzled, I was sure that I had left the football just outside our house!”</p>
<p>Mother and father gave Vishnu a big hug, saying, “What a wonderful idea that was, you really are becoming a very clever and caring boy!”.</p>
<p>Kritika then said cleverly, “The mystery of the Diwali presents has become the Diwali of the mystery presents, how fun!”. The family celebrated Diwali together then, bursting crackers and eating a tasty lunch that their mother had made.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many years have gone by since that year. The boys have grown up and have their own kids, the girl has just got married. The mother and father are older too, and they are well to do now, with their own house and enough money. The family still celebrates Diwali together every year and has a lot of fun bursting crackers, with presents for everyone and lots of food.</p>
<p>But every time them meet, they all remember that one Diwali and talk again about The Diwali of the Mystery Presents.</p>
