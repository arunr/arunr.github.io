        <p>Once upon a time, long long ago, there was a little girl called Swati and her younger brother Saurabh. Swati was nine years old and Saurabh was a big boy - he was seven years old, almost eight. Swati and Saurabh lived in a small apartment in a big, bustling city with their mother and father. It was winter when this story happened, cold and dark and gloomy. <a id="more"></a></p>
<hr>
<p>The kids didn’t like winter - it meant that they had to get ready in the morning in the cold, get all bundled up and go to school, and then once they got back from school they couldn’t go out anywhere, and had to just stay home. Their mother loved them both very much though, and would try to make them feel happy, by making them hot cocoa to drink and reading them stories or playing some silly games with them.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am telling you more about them than the story! Let me tell you what happened. See, Swati did one thing daily that was a big secret - no one knew about it other than her, not even her mother or her father or her brother.</p>
<p>Do you know what it was? Well, every night, before going to bed, she would go into her bedroom and shut the door. She would then take out a small white box from under her big brown bed. Then, from her cupboard she would get a tiny golden key and would unlock the small white box. Inside that small white box which was all lined with pink silk, there lay a square blue book.</p>
<p>Picking up the square blue book, she would scribble in it, writing for ten or fifteen minutes. Once she was done, she would snap the book shut and almost alway look up with a smile. She would then put the square blue book in the small white box, lock it with the tiny golden key and shove the box under her big brown bed. Afterwards, she would open her bedroom door, kiss her parents and brother good night, say a little prayer and go to bed.</p>
<p>Well, what do you think Swati wrote in that square blue book which was in the small white box under the big brown bed?</p>
<p>She wrote a letter to God. She loved writing, and she would sit down daily and write one letter - just saying whatever came to her head, whatever she felt like sharing with God.</p>
<p>Swati didn’t really know why she was so secretive about this, maybe she felt a little shy of her writing and didn’t want anyone to read what she had written!</p>
<p>But I know what she wrote, I read all those letters!</p>
<p>One day after taking the square blue book out from the small white box which was under her big brown bed and unlocking it with the tiny golden key, she wrote in it…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear God,</p>
<p>Today I was not such a good girl. I pulled Saurabh’s hair and made him cry, but he was being so bad, he was dancing in front of the TV and not letting me watch my favorite cartoon!</p>
<p>Anyway, the other thing I wanted to tell you was that my birthday is coming in two moths. No pressure!</p>
<p>I am feeling excited about tomorrow, because there is dance class in school, and I really enjoy dancing.</p>
<p>Love you, &amp; talk to you more tomorrow, I’m feeling sleepy early today,</p>
<p>Swati<br>Another day, she pulled out from under her big brown bed the small white box and after unlocking it with the tiny golden key she took out her square blue book and wrote in it…<br>Dear God,</p>
<p>Today, I came second in class. I wish I had come first, but I think it is OK, because father said that it is more important to try hard than to always win.</p>
<p>What do you think? Tell me in my dreams, you never write back to me!</p>
<p>Now that exams are over, we have holidays. All the other kids are going on vacation to their grandparents house, or to see some new place, but mother &amp; father said we cannot go anywhere this year and have to stay at home, because father doesn’t have vacation from office.</p>
<p>What a bore!</p>
<p>You take care now,</p>
<p>Swati<br>Like this, every day, without fail, she would unlock the small white box that was under her big brown bed with her tiny golden key, take out the square blue book and write in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Swati was very happy with this secret - it was like a special thing between her and God!</p>
<hr>
<p>One day, this winter, Swati &amp; Saurabh’s mother fell really sick. She was admitted to the hospital. In the hospital, the doctors and nurses used to speak in hushed voices with their father, making Swati feel very scared for her mother.</p>
<p>Every evening, their father would bring the kids home from the hospital, make them dinner and put them to bed, and then go back to the hospital to spend the night there.</p>
<p>Many days went by like this. Their father developed dark circles under his eyes, he lost a lot of weight and he stopped speaking much, trying at times to control himself from crying. Their mother lay in bed all day in the hospital, with barely enough energy to talk to them for a few minutes daily. Things were not looking good.</p>
<p>Through all this, Swati had continued writing in her square blue book, writing daily to God, telling him about how her mother was in the hospital, how she wanted her mother to become well and come back home soon.</p>
<p>The days became weeks, and then more than a month had gone by. Swati continued to write in her square blue book daily. Nowadays, she had a worried look on her face once she had finished her letter, not her old smile.</p>
<p>One day, Swati wrote this letter to God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear God,</p>
<p>I am feeling very scared. Ma was worse today in the hospital, she could barely talk. The Doctor came and said something to father, and I saw tears in fathers eyes.</p>
<p>Can you please make Ma OK, I promise that I will be good - I will not fight with Saurabh, and I will work harder at school and always listen to whatever father or mother says. I will do anything, please make her OK.</p>
<p>You never talk to me, I am angry at you - are you really there? Send me a reply.</p>
<p>Swati<br>She then shut the book loudly, dragged out the small white box from under her big brown bed, shoved the square blue book into the box and locked it with her tiny golden key. She was tired, and she flung herself on the bed and fell asleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The next evening, when Swati took out the small white box and opened it, she noticed a crumpled piece of paper in the box.</p>
<p>Where had that come from? She was puzzled, and she pulled it out. The paper was very old and was a yellow in color, thick like parchment. On the paper, in big, bold letters written in black ink it said,</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="She_will_get_well_sune!"><span style="font-style:normal;"><strong>She will get well sune!</strong></span></h2><p>A reply from God!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Swati yelped with delight when she read the paper. She jumped almost two feet in the air, let out a cry and ran outside. Her father was eating dinner, and she showed him the reply from God, and told him about her square blue book in a hurried voice, gasping for breath. Father was puzzled, and he asked her to slow down and tell him once again what had happened.</p>
<p>She told him, about how she wrote a letter to God in the square blue book daily, about how she had written that letter yesterday and how, now there was the piece of paper inside the small white box, a reply from God.</p>
<p>Father turned the piece of paper over in his had, and said, “This is most peculiar, it seems like a miracle.”</p>
<p>He then said, “Let us go show this to mother.”</p>
<p>He took the kids to the hospital in the evening, something he had never done before. When they got there, Swati ran to her mothers bed side and told her about the square blue book, and the reply she had received from God.</p>
<p>Her mother listened carefully and looked at the piece of paper. “I can’t believe this, Swati. The paper is so old, and the writing is so clear, it looks very real,” she said, “Anyway, I am so happy that you have been writing these secret letters to God for so long, I would like it very much if you read me a letter each day.”</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, Swati sat daily with her mother and read from her square blue book, every day she read one of the letters she had written to God. Every day they spoke about the mysterious reply from God, feeling the paper, looking at the ink closely and even smelling the letter.</p>
<p>Mother started becoming better, she was more cheerful and had more energy. The Doctors and nurses seemed more relaxed now. Swati’s father too seemed better, one day he even gave the kids a smile and ruffled their hair.</p>
<p>After about a month, Swati’s mother returned home. Swati had once overheard a Doctor say, “It’s a miracle, how the lady has turned around, I heard something about a mysterious letter from God.”</p>
<p>Swati was very, very happy.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saurabh was very happy too! His mother was home, his father looked more cheerful and he could continue to tease her and fight with Swati like the times before his mother was in the hospital.</p>
<p>He didn’t tell anyone about it, but Saurabh had a secret too. Under Saurabh’s big brown bed, there was a small grey box which could be opened only by a teeny silver key. Inside this box, very secret, was a toy parchment set, with a bottle of ink and some old, yellow paper…</p>
