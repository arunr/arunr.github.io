        <p>Once upon a time, long long ago, there was a girl called Ana. She was the sweetest little girl, and was very intelligent too! But Ana couldn’t talk, because God had not given her a voice to speak with. She lived in a village with her mother, who loved her very much and understood everything that Ana wanted to say even without Ana ever saying a word. Ana’s father had died long ago before she was born, and so it was only Ana and her mother at home.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Ana was a happy child, and loved playing with animals. She had many animal friends at her house - a few horses, dogs, kitty-cats, and fish. Ana used to silently listen to the animals and take care of them very kindly. If you listen to animals quietly, you can understand what they are saying. You can see what they are saying in their eyes, in their bodies and by touching them on their skin. You  have to be very patient, silent - and then they will speak to you.</p>
<p>Though Ana was a sweet and intelligent girl, many of the kids in the village used to make fun of her because she couldn’t speak. They would bully her by throwing stones at her or taunt her my calling her <em>goongi</em>, which is the Hindi word for a girl who can’t speak. Ana used to be sad about this. But then she would go to her animal friends and feel much better, because they understood how she felt &amp; would comfort her. The horses would rub their noses on her forehead, the dogs would jump up and lick her face, the cats would rub their selves against her legs and purr and the fish would swim in circles for her in brilliant colors. How could she be sad then? She would immediately become happy and cheerful again.</p>
<p>Many days went by like this. The seasons changed and winter turned to sprint and then summer. One day a terrible thing happened - it was a very, very hot day, the kind of day when nothing moves. There were no birds in the sky, and even the crickets were silent. It was unusually quiet, when Ana went to see her animal friends. She got a shock when she saw them - the dogs started barking and jumping up and down, the horses started neighing loudly and the cats were screeching. The fish swam very fast and in no pattern, and their eyes were glassy with fear.</p>
<p>Ana was also scared, but then she became very quiet and tried to understand what the animals were saying to her. She petted the dogs and the cats and gently stroked the horses. She even rippled the water of the pond to calm the fish down! Once the animals became calm, Ana was able to understand what they were saying…</p>
<p>What do you think they told Ana?</p>
<p>They told her that an earthquake was coming. An earthquake is when the ground under your feet shakes, and many of the houses fall down. It is a very scary thing - and many people can get hurt in an earthquake. The best thing to do when an earthquake happens is to run out of the house and lie down on the ground.</p>
<p>As soon as Ana understood this from the animals she ran home. She found her mother, and tried to tell her what was happening, but she was very scared and her mother couldn’t understand what she was saying. “Calm down Ana,” her mother said, and gave her a big hug. Once her mother held her in her arms, Ana felt much better. She became quiet, and took her mother by her hand and ran outside the house and lay down on the ground. She acted out how the ground will shake to her mother, and her Ma finally understood that an earthquake was coming.</p>
<p>Her mother ran to all the other houses in the village, shouting, “An earthquake is coming, an earthquake is coming - please run out and lie down on the ground!”. All the villagers came out of their houses and lay down on the ground. In this time, Ana had gone and brought all her animals also outside into an open field.</p>
<p>Just then, the earthquake came and shook the ground beneath their feet. Many of the houses were damaged, but no one got hurt because everyone had heard Ana’s mother and come out of their houses.</p>
<p>After the earthquake had gone, the people of the village ran to Ana’s mother to thank her. They asked her “How did you know that an earthquake was coming?”.</p>
<p>Ana’s mother smiled and said “Ana told me! She took me out of the house and showed me how an earthquake was going to happen.”</p>
<p>All the villagers carried Ana on their shoulders then, because they were very happy that she had saved their lives. Ana became a hero, and none of the kids ever teased her again - in fact, they wanted to be her friends. Ana became friends with some of the good kids, but she never forgot her best and favorite friends - the animals that she loved so much.</p>
