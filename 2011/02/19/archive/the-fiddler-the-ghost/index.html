        <p>Once upon a time, long long ago, there was a fiddler. A fiddler is a person who plays a violin, which is also called a fiddle.</p>
<p>The fiddler loved playing his fiddle, and when he picked up the fiddle and started playing, a peaceful, child-like smile spread across his face. The fiddler used to play his violin from morning till night, in summer and in winter, and even in the rain! He would play his fiddle sitting under the shade of a tree during the summer and in a temple during the monsoons or the winter.</p>
<p>The fiddler played the violin really well, but he was very poor, for he used to love playing his fiddle so much that he didn’t even think for a minute of becoming rich or making money.</p>
<p>“I have all the riches of the world in this wonderful fiddle,” he used to say, holding his old wooden violin lovingly. Then he would start to play his fiddle, and all the people nearby would stop what they were doing and would come and sit by him to hear him play. They would be enchanted by the music and they would clap or cry out in appreciation! They would then insist that he stay for lunch or dinner, and they would treat him well and sometimes even give him money.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<hr>
<p>One day, the fiddler was sitting under a big old banyan tree in the jungle, playing his violin. There were no people there to hear him play, but he still played the best music he could. It didn’t matter to him whether people were watching or listening, he always tried to get the best music from his fiddle.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the fiddler heard a voice. “What a beautiful sound! Keep playing”, the voice said.</p>
<p>The fiddler looked around, and didn’t see anyone. He was very puzzled, but he continued to play the fiddle.</p>
<p>Then he heard the voice again, “I would love to play like you, what beautiful music your violin makes!”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is the most wonderful violin, isn’t it?”, the fiddler asked. “But who are you, and where are you hiding? Come, sit near me and I will play some more”, he said.</p>
<p>Swoosh, from the tree, from above the fiddlers head there was a gust of air and the ghost who was living in the tree came down and sat next to him.</p>
<p>“I am a ghost, and I live in this tree”, he said. Now, the ghost was not a bad ghost, it was just a very mischievous ghost. “Keep playing, please”, he said.</p>
<p>After listening to the fiddler for a long time, the ghost said, “I love the music your violin makes. Can you please give me your violin?”</p>
<p>The fiddler jumped up, looking shocked. “Dear ghost sir,” he said, “I know you really enjoyed the music, but I love my violin dearly, closer than my life. I have had this violin since I was five years old, and cannot part with it” he said, holding the violin to his chest.</p>
<p>“I will give you a lot of gold, make you very rich beyond your imagination, come, give me that violin”, the ghost said.</p>
<p>“No sir, I wont. I don’t care for riches anyway,” the fiddler said, “I have all the riches of the world in this wonderful fiddle. I don’t need any more money.”</p>
<p>“Fiddler, you are a fool. You will come back to me one day, and give me your fiddle!”, the ghost said, and then he disappeared back into the tree with a swoosh, chanting some mischievous magic as he went.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many days went by, and the fiddler forgot all about the incident with the ghost. He continued to play his fiddle, walking from village to village and town to town. That summer was very hot and dry though, and the fiddler found that people were less willing to give him anything for his music. He started looking even poorer, his clothes were torn and he used to get food only once in a couple of days. Whenever he used to feel tired or hungry, he would pick up his fiddle and start to play, and he would forget all his worries.</p>
<p>“You make me happy even in the most difficult times,” he would tell his fiddle, holding it close to him.</p>
<p>The fiddler didn’t know that the summer heat and the mean people were mischief done by the ghost. The ghost was hoping that the fiddler would come back when he was poor and hungry and would ask the ghost for money and would give him the fiddle.</p>
<p>However, the ghost saw that the fiddler was starting to love his violin even more in his difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>“Uggg Chugg Muggg!”, the ghost cried in anger and desperation, “I can’t believe this fiddler. I will have to make some more mischief to get him to give me the violin!”, he said, and he shouted out another mischievous spell.</p>
<p>The next day, the fiddler came to a big city in the morning. He was feeling quite hungry, so he sat under a tree at the crossroads of town and started to play his fiddle. Very soon, a small crowd had gathered near him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a man came up to him and said, “Sir, you play the violin most beautifully. Today is the wedding day of my masters daughter. My master is a very rich man, and he would be very happy it if there were such wonderful music on the occasion of his daughters wedding. Would you please come to the wedding and play your music for the people there, you can stay for lunch and I am sure that my master will reward you!”.</p>
<p>The fiddler was amazed at his luck, and he agreed to go to the wedding. He reached the wedding hall, sat down at the back of the hall and started to play. Many of the visitors and guest who had come to the wedding gathered near him, crowding around him.</p>
<p>“Wonderful, wonderful, what talent!”, a fat man cried.</p>
<p>“<em>Wah-wah</em>, what beautiful music!”, a lady said, waving from side to side.</p>
<p>“<em>Besh-besh</em>,_ _amazing, amazing, you are really good”, a thin man said, who had squeezed his thin body to the front of the crowd.</p>
<p>The fiddler was very happy to have such an appreciative audience.</p>
<p>Then, after the wedding was done, a fat man came out of the kitchen and called out loudly, “Lunch, lunch! Lunch is served, tasty wedding lunch, come and get your seats, first round of lunch!”.</p>
<p>As soon as they heard that call, the people listening to the music suddenly changed!</p>
<p>The fat man stopped paying attention to the music, and started paying attention to pushing himself into the the line for lunch.</p>
<p>The waving lady stopped waving at the music, and instead started waving furiously at her husband, calling out “Lunch, lunch, come lets stand in line, we will lose our turn.”</p>
<p>The thin man stopped clapping as soon as he heard the call for lunch, and started trying to squeeze himself to the front of the lunch line!</p>
<p>The crowd around the fiddler disappeared. No one stopped to ask him whether he would like lunch, they all just melted away, each of them thinking only about their own stomachs.</p>
<p>The fiddler felt very, very sad. He thought, “These people don’t really care about the music, they care only about themselves,” he thought, “I am so hungry and tired, and not one of these people cared.”</p>
<p>“People are selfish,” he thought, “and I am the only fool who is giving himself to the love of music, not caring about himself! That is why I have no money, no food and am so tired. All for the sake of this silly fiddle!”.</p>
<p>“This foolishness must stop, right now”, he decided, and got up and walked out of the wedding hall.</p>
<hr>
<p>The fiddler walked back to the big old banyan tree in the jungle, where he had seen the ghost.</p>
<p>“Ghost, ghost!”, he cried, standing under the tree. The mischievous ghost who had planned all this knew why the fiddler was there, but he didn’t come down yet.</p>
<p>“Ghost, ghost, come down from where ever you are, I want to give you my fiddle!”, he shouted again.</p>
<p>The ghost came down from the tree quietly, and said “Ah, did you call me, yes, how can I help you?”.</p>
<p>“Dear Sir, I want to give you my fiddle, do you remember that you said you would give me money for this fiddle. Well, I don’t want it any more, sir, can you take the fiddle and give me the money?”</p>
<p>The ghost said, “Hmm, OK. I really like that fiddle of yours, so I will take you to the river of gold and make you rich. Come, give me the fiddle,” the ghost said, holding out his hand.</p>
<p>The ghost took the fiddlers violin from him. The ghost then led the fiddler to a secret golder river, a river of flowing gold!</p>
<p>“Go on, dip your hand in the river and take as much gold as you want! You will be a rich man”, the ghost said.</p>
<p>The fiddler was very happy. He dipped his hands in the river and carried away a lot of gold, thanking the ghost profusely for his generosity and kindness.</p>
<hr>
<p>The fiddler took all the gold, and the first thing he did was to go to a shop and sell the gold for money. He then went to the best restaurant in the city, and ate the most wonderful and large lunch.</p>
<p>“This is the good life, I should have done this the first time the ghost offered me the money,” he said, patting his stuffed belly.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, the fiddler spent all the money he got from selling the gold.</p>
<p>He bought a large house in the city. He hired wonderful cooks who made him lovely breakfasts and lunches and dinners. He bought many nice fitting, smart clothes for himself. He found many servants, who took care of his every need from morning to night. He bought big fast cars. He threw fine parties, took dancing lessons and learnt to speak in a sophisticated way!</p>
<p>However, the fiddler was not happy. Many mornings he just lay in bed, looking glum.</p>
<p>“Sir, what’s the problem?”, his servants would ask him, for they were good servants who cared about him very much.</p>
<p>One day, he told them, “I used to be a fiddler in my past life, and I miss playing the fiddle!”</p>
<p>“Sir, is that it?”, they asked. They went away, and bought him many violins. There were violins of gold, and violins of silver. There were big violins, and small violins. There were old wooden violins shined to a polish, and new metal violins with chrome trimmings.</p>
<p>The fiddler played them all, and his servants would swoon and praise the music.</p>
<p>“Sir, you are really talented”, they would cry out.</p>
<p>But the fiddler was not happy inside. He missed the beautiful music his simple, old wooden violin made.</p>
<p>Day after day, month after month, he tried to forget his old violin and find happiness in the wealth he had. But he could never forget his old violin, because he really, truly loved it.</p>
<p>One morning he woke up, and he made a decision. He changed into simple clothes and slipped out of the house, without his servants or cooks seeing him.</p>
<p>The fiddler then walked to the big old banyan tree in the jungle. He heard a peculiar, screeching noise from the tree.</p>
<p>“Ghost, sir, please come down!”, he cried.</p>
<p>The ghost came out, looking puzzled, wondering who was there to see him. He held the fiddlers old wooden violin in his hand, he had been trying to play it. The ghost looked sheepish when he saw the fiddler there, and put the violin away.</p>
<p>“Ah, fiddler, it is you, what do you want?”, the ghost asked.</p>
<p>“Sir, dear sir, you must forgive me. I know it has been many days since I gave you my violin, but I must have it back”, the fiddler said.</p>
<p>“Have it back? But why?”</p>
<p>“Ghost sir, I have lots of money now, all the riches I could have cared for and all the food. But even after all this, I miss my old wooden fiddle. I can’t explain it, but that is the way it is! I am really sorry, and you can have back all your money - please, just please give me my old wooden fiddle back to me!”</p>
<p>The ghost laughed out loud, “How truly funny!”, he cried. “You really do love your fiddle, I can see that. I tricked you out of the fiddle, going to such great lengths to get the fiddle from you, but it is funny that I can’t get it to play even a single note for me! I think the fiddle too loves you too much, and only plays for you”, the ghost said.</p>
<p>“Fiddler, I am amazed at  your love for your violin, and envious too! But let that be, I am a kind ghost, though a little mischievous, forgive me for that. Fiddler, you can have your fiddle back, and you can keep the money too. I just want one promise, that you will play music for me one day a month.”</p>
<p>Saying this, the ghost gave back the violin to the fiddler. The fiddler was overjoyed to have his old wooden violin back, and he caressed it and held it close to his chest.</p>
<p>“Thank you, ghost sir,” he said, and thanking the ghost he walked back home.</p>
<p>His servants were overjoyed to see the fiddler back home, “Where had you gone sir?”, they inquired.</p>
<p>The fiddler told them the whole story, and played them a wonderful song from his old fiddle, and they had tears in their eyes from the beautiful music.</p>
<hr>
<p>The fiddler lived happily ever after in the city. He used to play his violin all day long, just like the old times.</p>
<p>For parents: The fiddler has since downsized his extravagant lifestyle. He has sold his palatial house, sold his big fast cars and has cut out the parties. He supports up-and-coming grunge acts with his money. In his free time, he campaigns for Green Peace!</p>
