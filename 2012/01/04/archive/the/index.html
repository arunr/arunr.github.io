        <p>Once upon a time, long long ago, there was a boy called Anand. In Hindi, Anand means joy, and Anand was indeed very happy and joyous. He was a curious and intelligent child as well.</p>
<p>Anand lived in a small village in the mountains. He had to walk up hill for one hour to get to school, and on the way back from school he and his friends would scamper down, cutting through the fields and forests, stopping to splash in the streams or look at the flowers.</p>
<p>The hill he lived in was very beautiful, and especially so in spring-time. Wild flowers of a thousand colors covered the hill. The trees were weighed down with apples. The streams swelled with fish small and large. The animals became more active in the forests, and Anand would spot deer, goats, rabbits and sometimes even mountain cats.  Anand loved his village, and the mountain that it was on.</p>
<p>One day, a man in a big car drove into Anand’s village and stopped at the headman’s house. There was a lot of excitement and curiosity among the villagers about who the man was and why he had come to their village. After spending about an hour at the headman’s house, the man in the car drove away.</p>
<p>Anand was curious too, and he asked his father, “Baba, who was that man and why did he come to Tauji’s house?”. Anand’s father worked with the village headman closely, and he had been present at the meeting. “Anand beta, that man was a big industrialist. He wants to start a plastic bottle factory near our village, and the government has asked him to get permission from the village panchayat.”</p>
<p>“Baba, is the factory a good thing?”, Anand asked.</p>
<p>“Yes beta, once the factory is here, we’ll all have jobs in the factory, and we’ll all earn more. Already all the young men of the village are leaving to go to Delhi or Mumbai to work in factories. Once we have a factory here, no one will have to leave or go away.”</p>
<p>“But won’t having a factory here mean that the forests will get cut down and the streams will get polluted? Will the fish die, will the animals leave? Won’t all the beautiful flowers on the hill disappear?”, Anand asked with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Beta, the Tauji is very wise. He has told the industrialist to wait. He too is worried about whether the factory will cause pollution and spoil our beautiful environment. But on the other hand, the people of the village don’t have jobs and are leaving the village - the factory will mean that they have jobs.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Aside: “Nika, what do  you think they should do? Should they build a factory that will give them jobs and money, but will make their streams dirty and will kill the fish and make the animals leave and the flowers die? Or should they say no to the industrialist, then all the people of village will go away far.”</p>
<p>Nika: “But if the village is so clean and beautiful then why are they going away?”!</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, as Anand walked to school he thought about this problem. He usually went to school with his friends, but today he had woken up early and he walked alone so that he could think. He saw the beautiful flowers and felt sad that they would all die if they had a plastic bottle factory there. He decided he would speak to his favorite teacher, the English teacher Verma-sir, and ask him what to do.</p>
<p>Anand hurried forward and when he reached school he rushed to the teachers office looking for Verma-sir.</p>
<p>Verma-sir heard the full story, and he said, “Maybe there is another way. Look Anand, you have to think about this carefully. The big industrialist wants more money. The village headman wants to make more jobs so that the young men of the village will not go away far to Delhi or Mumbai, and so that there will be more money in the village. You, and even the people of the village want that the mountain continue to remain beautiful, with the wild flowers and animals and the apples in the spring. May be you can find a way to have all three…”</p>
<p>“Verma-sir, I don’t know, how can I come up with an idea, I don’t know enough about this topic.”</p>
<p>“OK Anand, why don’t we do this? Why don’t you tell all your friends in the school about the problem, and maybe we can all think about this.”</p>
<p>Anand was excited, “Yes, and maybe you can help organize us all and we can find a way to solve the problem. Let me go right now and talk to my friends.”</p>
<p>Anand’s love for his village and the mountain gave him energy and he spent the entire week talking to all the students he knew in the school, and to many that he didn’t. His enthusiasm was infectious, and many students came to meet Verma-sir.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Verma-sir had thought of a good way to organize all the students. He asked some of the students to find out all about plastic bottle factories and how much pollution they caused. He asked some other students to read about and find out better alternatives to plastic bottles. He asked another group to find out all about the flowers, and the fishes, animals and birds of their mountain. He asked still another group to read and think about what kind of things they could ask the industrialist for to keep their mountain clean.</p>
<p>Anand worked with all the students, day and night gathering and putting together the information they found. At the end of 3 weeks, Anand and his friends who were working on the project had an idea - what if instead of plastic bottles the factory could make glass bottles? They worked furiously on this idea, and at the end of 4 weeks, they had a plan.</p>
<p>Anand, his friends and Verma-sir went to meet the village headman. They first started by telling him about all the flora and fauna of their mountain. The village headman was touched, for he had grown up in the mountains. They then spoke to him about the ill-effects of plastic bottle factories, the sound and smoke it would cause, the pollutants in the river dirtying the water and killing the fishes, the noise and the deforestation chasing away the animals. The village headman nodded his head.</p>
<p>“I understand beta that you love the mountains as much as I do. I also know, and understand better now thanks to your wonderful talk about the bad effects of the factory. But what can we do? The industrialist is offering money and jobs for so many people, if we turn him away, who will be there to enjoy this beauty?”</p>
<p>Anand stepped in, and said, “We have an idea for that, Tauji. Why don’t we tell the industrialist to start a glass bottle factory instead of a plastic bottle factory? Glass bottles can be re-cycled and are better for the environment. Also, we found out that the industrialist sells most of his plastic bottles to companies America, and we found out that companies in America are starting to switch to glass bottles, and this will be good for his business.”</p>
<p>“That’s a wonderful idea!”, the village headman said.</p>
<p>“Also, we should ask him to build his factory down-stream. We have found out a lot about the kind of things we should ask him for - to plant a tree for every one that they cut, to not pollute the water and air more than the standards and to run a clean and green factory.”</p>
<p>The village headman was very happy, and he hugged the boys. “You boys really love the mountain, and yet have done some good work to see how everyone can benefit. This is the true sign of good citizens. I will talk to the industrialist.”</p>
<p>“We all have to thank Verma-sir, he was the one who helped us do this hard work”, Anand and the boys chimed in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is Spring. Wild flowers of a thousand colors covered the hill. The trees were weighed down with apples. The streams swelled with fish small and large. The animals were active in the forest. In the distance, if you listen carefully, you can hear the sound of a factory. People are moving about in the village, rosy cheeked and happy.</p>
